Updates:
-Added buttons to have quick and easy acces to code information. Users can simply copy complete scripting setups to the clipboard and paste them
 into their own projects.
-Changed explanation and tooltip text a bit.
-Inspector is now cleaner and more understandable.
-Changed the names of device dropdown list to slot X. To better match the representation of the detected devices list. This way users know what slot to select.
-Visual indicator to show wether the microphone is active or not.
-Added a help button that links to the MicControl 2 website page. Users can read FAQ's and watch tutorial videos (no videos available for now, working on it).

-All tweakable variables are moved under the "Advanced settings" button.
-The loudness bar now also shows the current loudness value. You can still see the loudness's history' in the console by selecting the Debug toggle.
-Variables "Volume falloff, pann threshold and AudioListener" only show when Unity 4.x only! 3D sound is selected as these are obsolete in Unity 5.
-The device name and number now show in the inspector by selecting Show Device name(s). It is no longer required to go in playmode first to see what your
 devices are. Devices are also no longer printed to the console.
-The script will only be active when the game window is active. This is to prevent time lag and keeps the loudness variable realtime.
 the same rules apply when build.

Bugfixes:
-Fixed several bugs in the example scene. Everything should load properly now.

2.3
Updates:

-The project is no longer open source, removed community scripts as they where poorly maintained nor updated frequently enough.


-Faster microphone initialization.
-Created menu button under GameObject-Audio-MicControl.
-Loudness value is no longer static and can no longer be called from other scripts without setup.

-Users can now call data from multiple mic's by placing multiple controllers (this is the reason why Loudness is no longer static).
 This was possible before, but required users to tweak the scripts. This is now done by defautl.
 
-Adjusted the ReadMe file to correspond mentioned updates.
-Generators now have a Gizmo.
-Removed GUI properties: They where incomplete and obsolete.
-Created reference script on how to call MicControl data. The scripts also contain a few examples on how to do things like adding force to rigid bodies by blowing.
-3D sound is now only required for unity 4.x users, Unity  5 does this through the audioSource's spatial blend feature.
-re-structured folder hierachy.

Bugfixes:
-Cleaned up some errors in the example scene.
-Fixed audio delay when switching programs. Microphone now properly stops and re-initializes when application is active again.
