This message is for all users ranging from Unity 5.0.xto 5.2.x.

MicControl2 will always be build in the latest available version of Unity. Because of this all lower Unity versions will always have a port
of that original build. What does this mean? It means that the older Unity 5 users have acces to the latest build of MicControl2, except for the
example scene.

Is this MicControl2 version different from the version featured in the latest Unity 5 build? No, the complete MicControl2 system is a direct port with all the code included
and will work exactly the same. The Update log will contain the latest update notes and is present in both versions.


Both MicControl 2.6 in the latest Unity 5 build and MicControl 2.6 in an older Unity 5 build will be identical. With the exception of the example scene as this can not be ported.
Do you really need the example scene? Simply download the Asset in the latest Unity version.
